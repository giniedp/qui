## ColorPickerModel.value property

If `target` and `property` are not set, then this is used as the control value

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
value?: V;
```

## Remarks

The format is determined by the `format` property.

It is allowed to omit the '\#' character but the '\#' will be added on change

It is allowed to use single character form per component (\#f00 instead of \#ff0000) but it will always be written back as \#ff0000 on change
